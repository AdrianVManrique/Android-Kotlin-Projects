**Assignment Description:**

In the third assignment, we'll practice one of the core concepts in android development: Login functionality. It is one of the most common features in almost all apps. You can follow my lectures and utilize the provided codes. 

If you want help, please feel free to show your code to others or ask for help in our online discussion forum. If you work on your solution for a few hours and are still not done, you can turn it in, and we will award you credit. 

**In order to complete this activity, you need to take the following steps:**
1. You will need to create a project named **HW3_YOURNAME_PARTNERNAME** in android studio. 
2. In the MainActivity, you have the app name(CSUSM) and the app’s logo (CSUSM logo). Below the page, you have two buttons named Signup and Login. 
3. If you click the Signup button, it will go to another activity or fragment, where you will insert Email, Password, Confirm Password, Your Full name by pressing a button named “Create Account.” You have to verify the password with a confirm password field.  Pressing the “Create account” button will save the data into the firebase database. It will give an alert message or Toast message (You successfully created an account into the awesome app) once you successfully store the data into Firebase.
4. If you click the Login button, it will go to another activity or fragment. Here, you will enter your email id and password. If your entered information matches with your stored credentials, you will go to another activity and just display a message. **Hello CS481**. If your credentials don’t match, you will give an alert message: “Either your id or password is incorrect”.

**For uploading the project, you have to follow two steps:**

1. Create a folder name called **“Output”** inside the project **folder**. Make a small video showing your program functionality in the emulator and show your code as well. 1~2 minutes video is fine. 
2. Push your code with video in Github.
Your submission will be graded by watching the video or simply running the code and evaluating its functionality. It does not need to be perfect or bug-free to receive credit. Your code will not be graded on style, but we still encourage you to follow a good overall coding style for your own sake. 

:exclamation:**```If you have any confusion, please raise this issue before the class. I will try to clarify as much as possible.```**
